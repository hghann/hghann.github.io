<h1 id="Software%20Recommendations">Software Recommendations</h1>

<p>September 30, 2021</p>

<p>A lot of people know me for my &#8220;Just use&#8221; software series.
But while I try to make as many videos as possible to cover all the &#8220;free
software&#8221; replacements for software many people use daily, I couldn&#8217;t make a
video on every piece of software.</p>

<p>This article simply contains the software I use and recommend; Most of it
requires little to no eliteÂ® knowledge of GNU&#47;Linux or software in general;
which doesn&#8217;t mean learning is bad.  Operating Systems</p>

<h3 id="I%20prefer%20to%20run%20UNIX-like">I prefer to run UNIX-like</h3>

<h2 id="Operating%20systems.">Operating systems.</h2>

<p>Of course for the most part I run GNU&#47;Linux systems; Operating systems based
off the GNU core utilities and the Linux kernel that some people call &#8220;Linux
distros&#8221; for brevity. My Linux distro of choice is Arch Linux, mostly because
it offers a fast package manager with a large-enough pool of updated software,
all the configuration and software is kept as simple as possible making
maintainence a breeze, and the Arch User Repository offers an excellent way to
installs packages outside of the relatively small vanilla repos. The AUR makes
Arch (probably) the single distro with most software available for it.</p>

<h3 id="However%20this%20doesn&amp;#8217;t%20mean%20Arch%20Linux%20is%20flawless&amp;#8230;">However this doesn&#8217;t mean Arch Linux is flawless&#8230;</h3>

<h2 id="(Other)%20Operating%20Systems">(Other) Operating Systems</h2>

<p>I think many more advanced Linux users wish to compile more software, for
example their kernel, from source. Compiling your software from source offers a
lot of performance advantages, and for this a distribution like Gentoo or KISS
Linux is what I&#8217;d recommend.</p>

<p>There is also the issue of systemd, the init system of choice for Arch Linux.
Systemd does not follow the UNIX philosophy of being a small, simple,
one-purpose program that&#8217;s easy to understand; Just like the Linux kernel, it
is large and evergrowing, and mostly monolythic. I choose to use systemd and
Arch Linux merely out of necessity and convenience; A distribution such as
Artix, Arch Linux without systemd, may ship more broken or incomplete packages.
There are also some packages I use that rely on systemd. If you are willing to
live with these slight flaws, then Artix or Devuan is for you.</p>

<h2 id="Shell">Shell</h2>

<p>I normally have multiple shells installed on my system at once; Fish and Bash.
I have Fish set to my user shell due to its convenient autocomplete and memory
functions along with wonderful colorscheme compared to boring &#8216;ol Bash.
However, I still keep Bash installed and run it ocassionaly to run more complex
one-liner commands.</p>

<h2 id="Text%20Editing">Text Editing</h2>

<p>My choice of text editor is often vim; it offers a lot of complex and powerful
functionality while also being usable by anyone who can open and type in a
terminal. However, while I mostly use vim to write I understand why people may
wish to use a more &#8220;user friendly&#8221; option such as a graphical text editor. For
this I recommend gedit.</p>

<h2 id="Window%20Management&amp;#47;%22DE&amp;#8221;">Window Management&#47;"DE&#8221;</h2>

<p>I personally prefer using the Openbox floating window manager as I find it to
be the single one that most easily gets out of my way and puts emphasis on what
I really care about: The actual programs I run on my machine.</p>

<h2 id="Web%20Browser">Web Browser</h2>

<p>My web browser of choice is Ungoogled Chromium. This is a fork of Google&#8217;s
Chromium, but with all Google spyware and bloat removed. You get the
performance and wide support of Google Chrome, without any of the privacy
concerns. I chose to use this web browser simply because it&#8217;s the most
&#8220;minimalist&#8221; of them all, not counting independent web browsers like Suckless&#8217;
Surf.</p>

<p>A similar web browser is LibreWolf; essentially Firefox, but with all telemetry
and Mozilla bloat removed. It also includes uBlock Origin, which to some people
is a plus. Then there&#8217;s also the Brave Browser, which blocks ads and shows you
more &#8220;privacy respecting&#8221; ads to pay you in their crypto, BAT. I find it to be
a bit bloated and not exactly my sorta thing, but I don&#8217;t hate it or oppose
people using it.</p>

<h3 id="That&amp;#8217;s%20pretty%20much%20it%20for%20me.%20Most%20of%20my%20other%20recommendations%20of%20software%20can%20be%20found%20in%20my%20Just%20Use%20software%20series%20anyway.">That&#8217;s pretty much it for me. Most of my other recommendations of software can be found in my Just Use software series anyway.</h3>
