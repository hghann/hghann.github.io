# Lots of people on the Webring!

Alright, I know, the ["webring"](https://worthyox.github.io/webring.html) is
not actually a proper webring, just a list of poorly-linked websites, but I had
no idea what to name the page otherwise.

I've added lots of new websites to the
[webring page!](https://worthyox.github.io/webring.html) I've also added colorful
icons next to everyone, for extra visual flair! I'm probably going to add a few more
friends there, and maybe some social media links too.

Anyways, I hope whoever's subscribed to this RSS feed keeps enjoying these new
articles! I have tons more where this one came from!
