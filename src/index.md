Hey there!

My name is Steve and this is my personal website. I hope you enjoy browsing it as
much as I enjoyed making it!

On this website I usually post guides, tutorials, side projects, and thoughts
on software development. It may not seem like a lot, but that's by design. I'm
trying to remove distractions and focus on things that matter.
